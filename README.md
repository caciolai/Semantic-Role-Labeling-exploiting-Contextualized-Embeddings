# Semantic Role Labeling exploiting Contextualized Embeddings

This project implements a multi-headed deep model performing *argument identification* and *classification*, two of the four subtasks *Semantic Role Labeling* is traditionally divided into.

For copyright reasons the training data cannot be freely published and therefore is not included in this repo.

### Implementation

[Here](code.ipynb) is a copy of the Colab notebook in which I implemented my model and carried out its training.

### Report

[Here](report.pdf) is the report with the documentation of my model and the results it attains.
